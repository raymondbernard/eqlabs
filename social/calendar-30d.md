## 30-day Facebook campaign calendar (EQLabs.ai)

Audience: AI researchers, applied ML/agents engineers, founders, investors
Goal: Grow awareness for deterministic evaluation (EQUATOR), seed our FB Group, drive email intros and demo requests
Cadence: 1 post/day + 15–25 meaningful comments across groups/pages

Legend: [P] Primary post, [C] Comment threads, [L] Link, [V] Video, [Q] Question/Poll

Day 2 — P: 3 binary criteria we use: Correctness, Completeness, Groundedness [L] `/index.html#benchmark`
Day 3 — C: Comment on 10 threads about hallucinations; add one actionable metric (Groundedness%)
Day 4 — P: Failure taxonomy teaser + invite to join our new group [Q]
Day 5 — P: Case: when smaller LLMs outscore bigger on reasoning (cost focus)
