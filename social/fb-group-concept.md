## New Facebook Group concept

Working name: Deterministic AI Reasoning & Evaluation (by EQLabs)
Alt: Deterministic LLM Evaluation — EQUATOR Community

Purpose
- Bring together researchers, engineers, and founders to make open‑ended LLM reasoning measurable and reproducible.

Who it’s for
- People who want binary criteria, groundedness, blind studies, and practical QA for agents.

Positioning
- Vendor‑light, research‑first. Our work (EQUATOR) is one member among peers. No mass promos.

Group rules (short)
1) Be respectful. 2) No spam or self‑promo without context. 3) Share reproducible evidence when possible. 4) No job posts without moderator OK. 5) Cite sources.

Onboarding questions
- What makes LLM evaluation hard at your org today?
- Which binary checks do you enforce (if any)?
- Would you join a 30‑min AMA? Add your email.

Branding
- Cover image: clean grid motif with "Deterministic Evaluation" headline; size 1640×856.
- Featured tags: #DeterministicEvaluation #Groundedness #EQUATOR

Moderation cadence
- Daily: admit 3–10 members; prune spam quickly.
- Weekly: AMA or deep‑dive thread; spotlight best comment.

Launch plan
- Soft launch day 11 (calendar). Seed 10 posts, then invite early commenters from other groups. Aim for first 100 members in 14 days.
