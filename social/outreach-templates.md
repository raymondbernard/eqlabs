Hi [Name] — your comment on [topic] hit on the core challenge we see: [short paraphrase]. We’re building deterministic evaluation (binary criteria + blind studies). Would you be open to a 15‑min riff or to share 1 example where your eval failed you? Happy to trade notes and credit any insight in a summary post.

Moderator (group owner)
Hi [Name], love how you keep [Group] focused. We’re launching a vendor‑light discussion series on deterministic LLM evaluation (no promos, reproducible evidence only). Could we post a weekly deep‑dive thread and an AMA next week? We’ll follow your rules and highlight the best member contributions.

Influencer (creator)
Hey [Name], your audience cares about agent reliability. I can prep a 60‑sec breakdown: “Why binary checks beat vibes for open‑ended reasoning” tailored to your tone. If it resonates, we can co‑host a short Q&A in your group. Zero hard sells.

Investor/partner
Hi [Name] — quick intro from EQLabs (NYC). Our thesis: better AI starts with better measurement (deterministic evaluation). We’re curating a benchmark of real‑world reasoning failures with blind studies. If this intersects your thesis, could we swap a 2‑pager and see if there’s a fit for a pilot intro?

Follow‑up (no reply)
Bumping this once in case it got buried — totally fine if not a fit. If you’re curious, what would make this useful for your audience/team?
