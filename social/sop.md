## SOP — Daily Facebook campaign (EQLabs.ai)

Objectives
- Awareness for deterministic evaluation/EQUATOR; recruit collaborators; drive warm intros/demos.

Daily workflow (60–90 min)
1) Prep (10m): review notifications and yesterday’s top 5 replies; note follow-ups.
2) Primary post (10m): publish per `calendar-30d.md` with 1 crisp visual when possible.
3) Commenting sprint #1 (20m): 8–12 high-signal comments using `comment-bank.md` across target groups.
4) Commenting sprint #2 (15m): reply to any responses; ask one pointed follow-up.
5) Group care (10m): approve members, welcome thread, remove spam, react to quality posts.
6) Outreach (10–20m): send 3 DMs (collab/mod/influencer) using templates.

Content standards
- Max 4 lines body; 1 question; no outbound link unless context demands. Screenshot > raw link.
- Tone: evidence-led, respectful, research-first.

UTM & links
- Use `social/utm-params.md` for campaign links; avoid overlinking in comments.

KPIs (daily)
- Primary: meaningful comment count (>=15), quality replies (>=5), group joins (>=5/day during launch), DMs sent (>=3).
- Secondary: post reactions/comments, profile link clicks, demo interest emails.

Weekly review (30–45 min)
- Identify 3 best performing topics; replicate angles next week.
- Prune low-signal tactics; update `experiments.md`.

Risk controls
- No debate wars; exit after 1 clarification and 1 evidence point.
- No sensitive data; no claims without sources.
