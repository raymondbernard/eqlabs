## Experiments, pivot rules, weekly cadence

Hypotheses
- H1: Question-led posts drive 2× more quality replies than link posts.
- H2: Comment‑first days (no link) grow group joins faster than link‑led days.
- H3: Short video clips (≤90s) outperform text on saves and shares.

Experiments (run 7 days each)
E1: A/B post format — question vs link summary; measure comments/post.
E2: Comment‑only vs post‑only days; measure group joins and DMs.
E3: 60–90s clip vs static image; measure saves, shares, avg watch.
E4: Invite CTA phrasing — “join discussion” vs “join group”; measure clicks.

Pivot rules
- If post comments < 3 median for 3 days, switch to question‑first and add 1 controversy‑safe angle.
- If group joins/day < 3 during launch week, run AMA announcement and cross‑comment in 10 threads that day.
- If negative sentiment > 20% on a thread, de‑escalate and move to evidence summary, then exit.

Weekly cadence
- Mon: review KPIs; select top 3 angles to double‑down.
- Wed: run E2 or E3 variations.
- Fri: post community spotlight; share wins; schedule next AMA.

Tracking
- Maintain a simple sheet with: date, asset, format, primary KPI, secondary KPI, notes, next action.
