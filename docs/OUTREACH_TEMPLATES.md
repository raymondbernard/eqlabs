Subject: Exclusive: blind-study agents benchmark that beats [baseline] on [task]

Hi [Name],
We preregistered a blind-study benchmark (EQUATOR) with binary criteria and reproducible logs. Data room + deck + sandbox ready. 20‑min briefing; happy to hold until [date/time]. Interested?

## YouTube Creators
Loved your recent [video/topic]. We prepped a demo tailored to your audience + B‑roll + raw logs. Co‑build stream next week? 45‑min total, you keep the cut.

## X/Twitter Builders
Saw your thread on [topic]. We found a simple agentic loop that cuts [pain] by [X%] on EQUATOR. 30‑sec clip + repo + eval sheet. 15‑min first look under 48h embargo?

## Podcasts
We can bring a crisp thesis (where agents work, where they don’t), metrics, and a live demo. 30‑min slot next week?

## Newsletters/LinkedIn
Three diagrams + case study + try-now link. Co‑write or Q&A addendum available. Publish window [date/time].

## Communities (Reddit/Discord)
We’re hosting an open office hour with sandbox credits; mod shout-outs and giveaways included. Looking to schedule [date/time].
