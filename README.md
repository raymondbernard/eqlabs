# EQLabs.ai

The official website for EQLabs.ai — The Equator Intelligence Lab.

## About

EQLabs.ai is an AI research lab developing deterministic frameworks to evaluate and improve reasoning in large language models. We operate at the intersection of AI reasoning, evaluation, and alignment.

## Features

- Modern, responsive design built with Tailwind CSS
- Smooth scroll navigation
- Featured research: EQUATOR Evaluator paper
- Embedded video explainer
- Reasoning benchmark details
- Investor and contact information

## Research

Our paper, [EQUATOR Evaluator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00257), formalizes a deterministic approach to judge open-ended reasoning beyond surface fluency.

Key features:
- Deterministic scoring beyond surface fluency
- Human-validated reference sets & semantic matching
- Cost-efficient local evaluators (small LLMs)

## Collaborations

- Columbia University
- Vector Institute

## Deployment

This site is deployed on GitHub Pages at: https://raymondbernard.github.io/EQLabs.ai/

### Custom Domain (optional)

If you later want a custom domain, re-add a `CNAME` and configure DNS. For now, this site uses the default GitHub Pages URL.

## Local Development

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser. The site uses CDN-hosted Tailwind CSS, so no build process is required.
